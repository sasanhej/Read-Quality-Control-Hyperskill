  \ of raw sequencing data. We have a small test for you â€” select the best bacterial\
  \ data archive and explain why. The archives are attached below. It would be excellent\
  \ if your program could also indicate various data quality metrics. Good luck!</p>\r\
  \n\r\n<p>We are looking forward to hearing from you,</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Your HR.</p>\r\
