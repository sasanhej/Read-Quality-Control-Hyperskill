# Read-Quality-Control-Hyperskill
This is "Read Quality Control Hyperskill" project form Hyperskill.<br>
Dive into the world of bioinformatics by exploring one of the basic data types: sequenced data. Learn about key parameters of data quality and automate data evaluation with Python. Come to know how to utilize programming for real-world biological tasks. If you love to solve problems at the intersection of the sciences, this project is for you.<br>
We've received your application for the bioinformatics researcher position. However, It is not clear from your CV whether you have the skills to assess the quality of raw sequencing data. We have a small test for you â€” select the best bacterial data archive and explain why. The archives are attached below. It would be excellent if your program could also indicate various data quality metrics. Good luck!<br>
Note: This repository contains all files from Hyperskill for evaluating each step of the project and quizes and etc.<br>
